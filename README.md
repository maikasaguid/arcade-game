##Instructions
1. Select your character, but choose wisely, as some are wider than others and thus have more lives.
2. Navigate through the bugs to get to the water by using your left hand (W-up, D-right, S-down, A-left) or right hand arrow buttons.
3. You win the game once you reach the water in the 10th level.
